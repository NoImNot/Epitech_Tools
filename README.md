You just have to donwload init.sh, chmod it if needed, launch it where you want and let it do the job for you.

Current files versions:

init.sh:
- [x] Create "bin" dir (if it doesn't exists in your ~ (/home/$USER))
- [x] Check if git and zsh are installed (or will install those shit)
- [x] Create a temp directory with exotic name
- [x] Clone this repo (Epitech_Tools.git) in the temp dir
- [x] Move .sh in /home/$USER/bin
- [x] Move zshrc.cfg to /home/$USER/.zsrc
- [x] Remove temp folder
